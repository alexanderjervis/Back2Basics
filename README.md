This is meant to serve as both a review of the basic concepts of python and as a supplemental learning tool for those new to coding.

On top of covering the basics of python as a language this project will also help introduce more general concepts like version control, unit tests, and debugging.

Exercises prompts will also be provided to assist the understanding of concepts.

Thank you for reading and have a fun educational experience!
